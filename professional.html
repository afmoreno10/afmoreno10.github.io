      <p>I am currently an undergraduate student of two programs at Universidad de los Andes in Colombia. The first one is the program of Business Management at the School of Management, and the second one is the Systems and Computing Engineering program at the School of Engineering. For the first program, I tend to be more inclined by the fields of corporative strategy, consulting, entrepreneurship, human resources and marketing and for the second one I definetly preffer the web development and communications infrastructure fields. <br><br> In the summer of 2018, I took a semminar on entrepreneurship at Babson College in Wllesley, Massachusetts. There I had the pleasure to meet some of the funniest and joyfull people I have ever met, and some of the most well-prepared professors on the matter to start my own entrepreneurshipment soon. </p>

      <p>If there is something that drives my life is the service for other. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending if you see the glass half empty or half full, I discovered this not long ago, so it has been a total new adventure and a new way of seeing life. <br><br> Right now, I have been a volunteer at my university in a program where we mostly help students with some materials for their classes and laboratories, like books, gloves, safety glasses, calculators and other stuff. Also, we are very connected with the students that start their journey, better known as freshmen, so we provide guidance and counceling in any topic they need, academic or personal, it does not matter to us as long as we can provide help to make their life a little bit easier.</p>

      <p>Not everything has to be studying, volunteering and shooting people with paintballs (although I wish was more of the last). While I was at a party I started to think that there should be a way to make drinking a more enjoyable experience. <br><br> So, in the summer of 2013, I decided to take a two month course to become a professional bartender, and fortunately I became one. Since then, the thing that I enjoy the most is to prepare cocktails at my friend's parties, mix different spirits and beverages to reach new flavours and colours. It is all about being creative, feel some inspiration and take risks to try and mix new stuff, even if they do not look like something you would drink outside your house, but always stay safe, do not drink crazy things alone.</p>
