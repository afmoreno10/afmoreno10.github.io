<h1> Andrés Felipe Moreno Marín Personal Web Page</h1>
<p>This is my first web page ever developed. It was made with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap and a little bit of JQuery. The main goal of it is to encourage the practice of new skills and web-dev-tools to improve it. The idea is to keep updating this web page as new learnings and technologies appear. </p>
